          <h3>ABOUT GAMA EDUCTION CONSULTANCY</h3><br>
          <p>Gama Education Consultancy is one of the pioneer education consultancies in Nepal. It is registered under the company act of Nepal Government. To our knowledge, we are the only study abroad consultant in Nepal with a 100 percent visa success rate in recent years. We are located in Putalisadak â€“ a central location in Kathmandu.
            <br><br> We succeed every time because we are not just looking to add up the number of students we serve. Our target is to help the students shape their career effectively. We help the students choose the best country, city, universities and courses. Our counselors and consultants are well versed with the latest immigration rules of the destination countries and have ample experience in providing guidance to international education aspirants. 
            <br><br>Once a student walks into our office, his/her career goals become our responsibility. We do not believe that the role of a foreign education consultancy completes as soon as the student obtains a visa. We help our students settle down in their destination countries by connecting them with our past students, other Nepalese already there and our international representatives in those countries.
            <br><br>Our services include Study in Australia, Study in New Zealand, Study in USA, Study in UK, Study in Europe and preparation classes for test like TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, GRE, GMAT, PTE and ACT.</p>
